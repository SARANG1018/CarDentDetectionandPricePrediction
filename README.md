## Car Dent Detection and Price Prediction
This project focuses on car dent detection and price prediction using machine learning techniques. It provides a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit to facilitate easy interaction and visualization of the results.

# Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop a system that can detect and localize car dents in images. Additionally, the project aims to estimate the cost of repairing these dents based on their severity and location. By automating the dent detection process and providing price predictions, car owners and insurers can assess the damage more accurately and make informed decisions.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of a collection of car images, each labeled with the presence or absence of dents and their corresponding severity levels. The dataset was manually annotated by experts and is used to train and evaluate the machine learning models.

# Machine Learning Techniques

This project employs state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and techniques to accomplish the objectives:

Image Processing: Image processing techniques are utilized to preprocess the car images, enhance their quality, and extract relevant features for dent detection.

Object Detection: Modern object detection algorithms are trained on the dent-labeled dataset to accurately identify and localize dents in car images.

Regression: Regression models are trained on the dent-labeled dataset to predict the repair cost based on the severity and location of the detected dents.

# User Interface
The project incorporates a user-friendly web-based interface using Streamlit. Streamlit allows users to upload car images, visualize the detected dents, and obtain predicted repair costs interactively. The UI provides an intuitive and accessible way for users to utilize the dent detection and price prediction functionalities.
