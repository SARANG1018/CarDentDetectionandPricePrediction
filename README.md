## Car Dent Detection and Price Prediction
This project focuses on car dent detection and price prediction using machine learning techniques. It provides a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit to facilitate easy interaction and visualization of the results.

# Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop a system that can detect and localize car dents in images. Additionally, the project aims to estimate the cost of repairing these dents based on their severity and location. By automating the dent detection process and providing price predictions, car owners and insurers can assess the damage more accurately and make informed decisions.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of a collection of car images, each labeled with the presence or absence of dents and their corresponding severity levels. The dataset was manually annotated by experts and is used to train and evaluate the machine learning models.
